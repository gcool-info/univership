Over its course we learnt very many things.</p> <p>This is what we got wrong.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>#1 What draws users in is not what makes them use your product</strong></p> QWAKE started off as a cool idea: <i>what if you could send a picture to 3 random people in the world?</i></p> <p>Unfortunately, this cool idea had lots of problems. <p>Initially, people were attracted by the sharing mechanism. It’s almost poetic. It intrigued their curiosity & drew them in. But we found that they quickly got bored. The content was simply not interesting enough.</p> <p>It’s easy to see why. There are 7 billion people in this world. Each one is very different to the next: we like different things, we work in different places, we live in different areas. We share very little things in common with our neighbors. It is impossible to create engaging content by targeting everyone on earth.</p> <p>We attempted to reduce the geographic scope only to face the same problem. We saw that even though people may occupy adjacent physical spaces, they have vastly different interests. This is when we decided to add the feature of local communities. We’ll see how it goes.</p> <p>What we learn is simply that <strong>'BUYING' DECISION ≠ USAGE DECISION</strong></p> <p></p> <p><strong>#2 Code to adapt, not to scale</strong></p> I remember coding & trying to think how the system would scale. Every decision I made was guided by my desire to optimize the system for scalability & responsiveness. This was a mistake. <p>Coding for scale means that you know what you’re building. You’re attempting to optimize it. But in the beginning, you have no idea what that thing may be! You need to try out multiple ideas, quickly.</p> <p>You need to code for adaptability.</p> <p>Response times will suffer, data structures may be inefficient and the codebase will be a mess. Everything will probably be thrown away. But it’s the only way to make sure that you are building the right thing.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>#3 Treat competitive products as your own prototypes</strong></p> Initially we thought that no competitors existed. Of course, we hadn’t searched hard enough. <p>Each idea is shared by at least another dozen people in the world. Some of them will have executed on it. If the idea is relatively new, it will be difficult to track them down. But rest assured that they exist. My advice: spend at least 1 full week trying out different keyboard combinations on Google until you find them. And then, never stop searching.</p> <p>Our reaction to the discovery of a competitor was one of horror. Disappointment crept in. Not only were our ideas were similar but they were way ahead of us in the game.</p> <p>But then we changed our perspective. We started viewing the competitive product as our own prototype. We had something in our hands, which was built for free, tested for free and we just had to analyze the results. We put our competitive spirits aside and embraced it as our own prototype. The insights we gained were invaluable and allowed us to make the decision of launching the local community feature.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>#4 Answer 9 simple questions before you launch anything</strong></p> Before doing anything, we ought to have answered the following 9 questions. At every stage of the process, we needed to revisit them & make sure that we were still on track. <p></p> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementvalueproposition.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>What problem are we trying to solve?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementtargetmarket.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>For whom are we trying to solve the problem?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementmarketsize.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>How big is the opportunity?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementmetrics.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>How will we measure success?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagentcompetitors.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>What alternatives are out there?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementdiferentiation.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Why are we best suited to pursue this?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementmaretwindow.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Why now?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementgotomarket.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>How will we get it to market?</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-7 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/productmanagementrequirements.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-4 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>What factors are critical to success?</span> </div> </div> <p></p> <p></p> <p><strong>So, to sum up:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Understand what it is you're building by answering 9 basic questions</li> <li>Check whether your building a product or just a marketing campaign</li> <li>Treat competitive products as your own prototypes</li> <li>Code to adapt, not to scale</li> </ul> <p><i>Qwake is currently in private beta.
