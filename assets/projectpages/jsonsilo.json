Besides making a lot of new friends & living in subzero temperatures, I learnt how to code \"properly\" for the web. I followed best practices, I tested my code & implemented security mechanisms. What follows is a description of what I learnt. If you too want to pass on to the next web. dev. level, then read on!</i></p><p><i>The source code can be found <a href='https://github.com/reelyactive/json-silo/tree/encryption' target='_blank'>here</a>.</i></p><h2>What is reelyActive?</h2><p><a href='http://context.reelyactive.com/' target='_blank'>reelyActive</a> helps people, things & physical spaces exchange contextual information.</p><p>For instance, retail stores, restaurants, cafes want to get information about their customers. They wish to gain insights about them to better reply to their needs, target different client segments, etc.</p><p>reelyActive helps customers provide this information but with a twist: by giving something back to the users and not aggressively invading their privacy.</p></div><img src='assets/photos/jsonsiloexplanation.jpg' width='100%' /> <div class='container blog'> <h2>My Mission</h2> <br/> <ul> <li>Created a system allowing people to store & trade personal data via reelyActive, with the latter remaining agnostic of the data itself.</li> <br/> <li>Designed the overall system, wrote the back-end code, created functional & design documents.</li> <br/><li>The source code can be found <a href='https://github.com/reelyactive/json-silo/tree/encryption' target='_blank'>here</a>. Unfortunately, I cannot give away the Design Document which explains in detail the overall system architecture.</li> </ul> <h2>Skills Attained</h2> <p>I gained two very important skills during this placement related to <strong>Software Engineering</strong> & <strong>Coding</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Software Engineering</strong> refers to the ability to design an IT system and clearly explain the reasoning behind the technical decisions made. People with this skill should be explicit, patient, strong communicators, natural team leaders & follow best practices.</p> <p>Here are a couple of things I consider to be part of Software Engineering. The amount by which I developed them during my placement was evaluated by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1177951&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=Is05&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2Cidx%3A2-2-3%2CtarId%3A1430901751761%2Ctas%3Aje' target='_blank'>Jeff Dungen</a>, reelyActive's CEO.</p> </div> <table width='100%' style='background-color:#dddddd;color:#242424;padding:1.7em 10% 1.7em 20%;font-size:1.3em;border-collapse: separate'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='50%'> Restful APIs <p style='font-size:0.5em;width:50%'>The ability to design a software architecture based on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer' target='_blank'>Representational State Transfer (REST)</a> guidelines.</p> </td> <td width='50%'> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='50%'> Test Driven Development <p style='font-size:0.5em;width:50%'>Design a development cycle based on the principles of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development' target='_blank'>Test Driven Development (TDD)</a>.</p> </td> <td width='50%'> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='50%'> Creation of Functional Specs <p style='font-size:0.5em;width:50%'>The creation of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification' target='_blank'>Functional Specifications</a> to describe the requested behavior of the system.</p> </td> <td width='50%'> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='50%'> Creation of Design Document <p style='font-size:0.5em;width:50%'>The creation of a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_document' target='_blank'>Software design document</a> to explain the workings of the overall system.</p> </td> <td width='50%'> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='50%'> Linked Data <p style='font-size:0.5em;width:50%'>How can a machine 'understand the Internet'?</p> </td> <td width='50%'> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br/> <div class='container blog'> <p>Although I consider all of them very important, two of them really fascinated me and changed the way I code:</p> <br/> <ul> <li> <strong>The Semantic Web, Linked Data & JSON-LD</strong> allowed me to discover how we could make machines \"understand\" the information available on the Internet. I was so interested in this topic that I wrote an <a href='#/project/semanticweb' target='_blank'>entire article</a> on it. </li> <br/> <li> <p><strong>Test Driven Development</strong> showed me that there's a completely different way of developing software!</p> <p>Test Driven Development states that you should start testing before you write a single line of \"actual\" code. You run the tests (which obviously fail) and then it's time to start writing code to actually pass those tests. Once you're done, you write some more tests. And so on and so forth until you have no more time, money or have been driven mad!</p> <p>This way of writing code was a real revelation for me... Instead of creating functions which worked in \"near-perfect\" conditions I was forced to think about all the shitty things that could happen. I had to write code to handle all problems that could arise. This made my software way more robust, even though it took considerably more time to write.</p> <p>Also, when making a change, it was very easy to check whether other parts of the program were influenced. I simply had to run the tests and if they succeeded, I new that nothing was going wrong!</p> <p>Plus, there was some stupid sense of achievement when seeing all those green ticks on my console...</p> </li> </ul> <br/> <p><strong>Coding</strong> refers to the ability to implement an IT system. People with this skill should be prolific, efficient, quick learners, diligent & resourceful. During my placement, this is what I focused on:</p> </div> <table width='100%'' style='background-color:#dddddd;color:#242424;padding:1.7em 10% 1.7em 20%; font-size:1.3em;border-collapse: separate'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='50%'> node.js <p style='font-size:0.5em;width:50%'><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js' target='_blank'>node.js</a> is a javascript runtime environment for server-side applications.</p> </td> <td width='50%'> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> <i class='fa fa-star-o'></i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='50%'> Authentication Mechanisms <p style='font-size:0.5em;width:50%'>Implemented a system to authenticate users with <a href='http://jwt.io/' target='_blank'>JSON Web Tokens</a>.

I hadn't really done this before but I soon realised that it's incredibly important!</p> <p>When coding with others, it is necessary to agree upon a set of coding standards. If not, everyone follows his own style making the code illegible. For instance, I have a preference for tabs but Jeff likes spaces for indentation. If we work together on a project, it will be very difficult to read each others' code..!</p> <p>We therefore set out to define a coding style for node.js & restful APIs. You will find it <a href='https://github.com/reelyactive/node-style-guide' target='_blank'>here</a>. Feel free to re-use it as much as possible and help create some standards when writing code for node.js!</p> <h2>Thank you!</h2> Overall, it was a really steep learning curve but I learnt so much stuff in so little time. I really want to thank Jeff for helping me out and giving me the opportunity to work on this amazing project as part of my <a href='#'>Univership</a>! <p><div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'><iframe class='embed-responsive-item' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zFq_Xgyxj8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0'></iframe></div></p></div>",
