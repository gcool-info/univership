I want to change people's lives. I hate working alone. I’m stubborn.

What can I do? Which job could suit these interests?</p> <p>Three weeks ago I heard about product management. I was intrigued. I searched online. I talked to actual professionals. I interviewed people who work closely with them. I read an <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Inspired-Create-Products-Customers-Love/dp/0981690408' target='_blank'>excellent book</a> on the topic.</p> <p>This is what I learnt...</p> <p><i>Note: What follows mostly applies to digital product managers (i.e. developing web platforms, mobile applications, desktop software, etc.)</i></p> <br/> <h2>WHAT IS A PRODUCT MANAGER?</h2> <p>A product manager investigates, selects, and drives the development of products for an organization. Products that are valuable, usable and feasible. Valuable & usable to & by the customer and feasible by the organization. He sits in the intersection of Design, Engineering & Business. He the CEO of the product.</p> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-10 col-md-5 col-centered'> <img src='assets/photos/productmanagementvenn.png' width='100%'> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='container blog'> <p>In my eyes he is more like a facilitator rather than a dictator. He not only gives a purpose but also acts as the grease between engineers, designers and businessmen. He always acts as the voice of the user: if the product isn’t valuable to him/her, it’s not worth it.</p> <strong>Product Managers are not...</strong> <ul> <li>…project managers: who make sure that everyone follows the schedule with respect to both time & money</li> <li>…product marketers: who tell the world about the product</li> <li>…engineers: who build the actual product</li> <li>…designers, whether they be:</li> <ul> <li>…interaction: who map product requirements to wireframes</li> <li>...visual: who skin the wireframes, producing the overall look & feel</li> </ul> </ul> <br/> <h2>HOW DO YOU CREATE A PRODUCT?</h2> <p>Creating a product has 2 distinct phases:</p> <br/><br/> <div class='col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-centered small-margin-top'> <img src='assets/photos/productmanagementdiscovery.png' width='95%'> </div> <div class='col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-centered small-margin-top'> <img src='assets/photos/productmanagementimplementation.png' width='95%'> </div> <br/><br/> <h3>Discovery: Build the right product</h3> <p>How do we build the right product? We first need to identify the problem. Then explore multiple solutions and flesh out the optimal one. Here are some techniques I recently learnt about and others which I have experimented with:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Define Product Principles</strong>: Create a public declaration of your beliefs & intentions. It’s almost like a manifesto. It embodies what the company is trying to achieve. Product principles do not define product features; they serve as the basis for discovering them. For example, “<i>we believe in having minimal environmental impact</i>”.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Perform Site Visits</strong>: Observe people trying to accomplish a task in their natural habitat. What frustrates them? What infuriates them? What saddens them? What hurts them? What makes them feel bad? This is where we can intervene. This is where we can create a product.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Get hard data</strong>: Customer surveys, site analytics, market analyses & forecasts can be great tools to understand the current landscape.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Research the competition</strong>: Test competitive products. Test them to a ridiculous extent. Find out where they fall short. Find out where they’re performing best. I recently spent days testing out bluetooth tracking devices. Endless days of testing showed me where they fell short and how we needed to manage our user expectations.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Perform a Product Opportunity Assessment</strong>: Don’t think about the solution. Focus on what the problem is.

They should personify user behaviors, attitudes & goals - learnings captured by observing & interviewing users. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cooper' target='_blank'>Alan Cooper</a> provides excellent advice on personna creation in his book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/0470084111' target='_blank'>About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design</a>. Personnas can drive definition of product requirements & prototyping.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Create Product Requirements</strong>: Create a list of features that the product could have. These are not written in stone. They can be erased, re-prioritized or deleted. Agile User Stories can be an excellent tool, since they always place the focus on the end-user. I recently wrote a <a href='http://univership.org/#project/ecommerceandagile' target='_blank'>blog post</a> exploring how we can write them.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Make Prototypes</strong>: Make prototypes, from low-fidelity paper mockups, to high-fidelity ones. They help communicate the vision for the product and make everything clearer. Words can often be tricky. There is no better product specification than a high fidelity prototype. Engineers will have an unambiguous understanding of what they need to accomplish if we provide them with one.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Perform Usability Tests</strong>: Prototype at all stages and test with real users. Whether they be <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping' target='_blank'>paper mockups</a>, <a href='http://www.invisionapp.com/#tour' target='_blank'>inVision apps</a> or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype' target='_blank'>functional prototypes</a>. This is the best way to get feedback and improve it before it’s too late. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Krug' target='_blank'>Steve Krug</a> provides excellent advice on inexpensive testing in his book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758' target='_blank'>Don’t make me think</a></li> <br/> <li><strong>Work with a Prototyper & a Designer</strong>: In the discovery phase, we want to prototype as many solutions as possible. Working closely with a prototype engineer and a designer can provide us with the necessary flexibility to do this. Note however that a prototype engineer is not our “typical” engineer. He/She needs to be ok with writing code which will get thrown away very often…!</li> </ul> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-10 col-md-5 col-centered'> <img src='assets/photos/productmanagementimplementation.png' width='100%'> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='container blog'> <p>If you are happy with your high-fidelity prototype, it’s time to build the actual product. A lot of people will suddenly get involved, including engineers, project managers, marketeers, interaction & visual designers, executives, etc. These are some of the things to take in consideration.</p> <br/> <li><strong>Development</strong>: We should decide on the software development approach to follow. Two of the most common ones are Agile (within which many methods exist) & Waterfall. I recently wrote a <a href='http://univership.org/#project/ecommerceandagile' target='_blank'>blog post</a> exploring the former.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Beta-test</strong>: A beta-test can function as a way to create an initial loyal user base which will give you feedback & evangelise the product.</li> <br/> <li><strong>Continuous Integration</strong>: Instead of waiting to release new versions, any time a new feature is developed, it is pushed to production. Given that most users have internet, the feature is tested immediately and improced.</li> <br/> <h2>BECOMING A PRODUCT MANAGER</h2> <p>One major question haunts me today.</p> <p>How can you enter the workforce as a product manager? There is definitely no degree to help this transition. Many of the people I talked to say they started off as an engineer or a designer in an organization and slowly transitioned into that role. They were therefore specialists in one specific domain, at least in the beginning.</p> <p>What happens though if you don’t want to work as an engineer or a designer or a businessperson for a couple of years before changing career paths? Is this the compromise you need to make?</p> <p>Any advice would be really helpful. You can email me any thoughts or comments here: george.koulouris1@gmail.com.
