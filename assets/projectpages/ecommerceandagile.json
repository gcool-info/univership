Most of the web development projects I had been involved with followed the following process:</p> <br/> <img src='assets/photos/lineardev.jpg' width='100%' /> <br/> <p>Truth is, most of these projects were custom websites with tight budgets. I wanted to see how a larger & more traditional software product was developed. A nascent e-Commerce platform seemed to be like a nice place to learn.</p> <p>In this case, the process of developing the eCommerce platform looked more like this:</p> <br/> <img src='assets/photos/agiledev.jpg' width='100%' /> <br/> <br/> <h3>User Stories</h3> <div class='row'> <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-4'> <img src='assets/photos/agileuserstories.jpg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-8'> <p style='margin-top: 0;'>I was surprised to find that it all started with User Stories. We didn’t bother with mock-ups when starting off. eCommerce websites have been around for almost 2 decades.</p> </div> </div> <p>They have been well studied and tested. Users know the conventions. Try anything too crazy and you may drive people away from purchase. It suffices to look at the most successful platforms and copy their features.</p> <p>The first step therefore was to fire-up a google spreadsheet and create '<strong>Epics</strong>'. These are high-leve user goals (<i>e.g. buying a product, getting help, etc.</i>). Each Epic contained multiple user stories following the format:</p> <p><i>As a _____________ I want to _____________ Because _____________</i></p> <p>The most important question was the level of detail to aim for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Too broad</strong>: '<i>as an end user I want to buy a product because I like it</i>'</li> <li><strong>Too detailed</strong>: '<i>as an end user I want the cart button to be on the top right corner on desktop because it’s a well established convention</i>'</li> <li><strong>Just about right</strong>: '<i>as an end user I want to know that shipping is free because it impacts my buying decision</i>'</li> </ul> <p>A good way to decide whether the story had a sufficient level of detail was to use the INVEST mnemonic:</p> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/investindependent.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Not dependant on other user stories</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/investnegotiable.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Can change through conversation with stakeholders</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/investvaluable.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Brings value to the user</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/investestimatable.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Team understands it well enough to estimate time</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/investshort.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Fits in a sprint (<i>20hrs / dev / week</i>)</span> </div> </div> <br/> <div class='row row-centered'> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <img src='assets/logos/investtestable.svg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-centered' style='vertical-align: bottom;'> <span class='blue'>Should meet acceptance criteria</span> </div> </div> <br/> <p>You can find a sample of the user stories we created <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KpUZpBdFtd4e0FeTskbJwLfV1Hiv7qXajYewowekJdw/edit#gid=0' target='_blank'>here</a>. Note that some of them need further breaking down (<i>we still aren’t sure whether they should be implemented</i>).</p> <p>If you are really into eCommerce websites, <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1krEpRSkO8-4J12d8TqAoFLeeI9MvBZk_MIcqmTv0zvs/edit#gid=0' target='_blank'>this table</a> provides a comparison of non-trivial user stories implemented by successful e-commerce platforms.</p> <h3>Mockup</h3> <div class='row'> <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-4'> <img src='assets/photos/agilemockup.jpg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-8'> <p style='margin-top: 0;'>The mockup serves as a way to validate / improve user stories as well as define the visual design. By moving back and forth between the mockup and the user stories, we can add/remove/improve the latter.</p> </div> </div> <h3>Backlog</h3> <div class='row'> <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-4'> <img src='assets/photos/agilebacklog.jpg' width='100%' /> </div> <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-8'> <p style='margin-top: 0;'>Once we have a pretty good understanding of which user stories seem to be important, we add them to the backlog.

Each developper is given 10 'time' points per week (<i>1 point = 2h</i>). If a user story is not clear then it can be redefined by the team.</p></p> </div> </div> <p> If it is not clear how much time it will take, the developper can perform a 'spike'. A spike is usually a 1-point time window during which he/she can research how the story could be implemented and how much time it would take. Most spikes occur for user stories involving integration with 3rd party systems (<i>e.g. warehouse API</i>).</p> <p>Developers are also encouraged to write their own tests. Having a separate Quality Assurance team often results in developers writing code just to pass the tests. When they are responsible for both aspects they feel more responsible & create better quality software.</p> <h3>Some Cool Tools</h3> <ul> <li><strong><a href='https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira' target='_blank'>Jira</a></strong>: for project management</li> <li><strong><a href='http://www.seleniumhq.org/' target='_blank'>Selenium</a></strong>: for testing web applications</li> <li><strong><a href='https://jenkins-ci.org/' target='_blank'>Jenkins</a></strong>: for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration' target='_blank'>continuous integration</a> (<i>when stories are pushed into production immediately after being implemented</i>)</li> </ul> <h3>Critique</h3> <p>In this project I was only involved in writing the user stories. The hardest part was getting the level of detail right. But being exposed to many examples, placing myself in the shoes of a developper and having an expert guide me through the process helped me a lot.</p> <p>Evaluating what a user wants & why he/she wants it was another challenging point. I believe that a user is person: a complicated personality with multiple (<i>often conflicting</i>) goals. It’s an over-simplification to assume that we can create generic people (<i>e.g. the end-user, the registered user</i>) and describe them as lines in a spreadsheet.</p> <p>To illustrate this, let’s take an example from the <i>Customer Support</i> epic:</p> <ul><li><i>As an end-user I want to be contacted when a customer support representative becomes available because I don't want to waste my time waiting</i></li></ul> <p>In this case I find that term '<i>end-user</i>'' is too generic. For example, this story may describe someone who would like to be disturbed at a later time and values efficiency. But for someone who seeks instant gratification it may come across as a lack of attention to customers. Taking a step further, the same user may find the same feature great at some times and horrendous at others (<i>e.g. imagine he/she is very busy when the call is made</i>).</p> <p>I believe that the approach we followed could be improved by creating personas & scenarios and thinking more about the goals of different types of users at different points in time. Perhaps this should be the starting point, before heading off to write user stories. I’d argue that it is essential, even for websites where strong conventions exist i.e. e-commence platforms. An excellent ressource on this topic is <a href='http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/0470084111' target='_blank'>About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design</a> by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cooper' target='_blank'>Alan Cooper</a>.</p> <p>As a final remark, I found this exercise incredibly interesting. I’d love to experience steps 2-4 and get a practical understanding of how this approach works in its totality.</p> </div>",
